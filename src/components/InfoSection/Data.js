    heading: 'Parikshit is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Parikshan’, which means ‘testing’. The Project started in 2010 with the goal of increasing student industry link, contributing to the country’s space program and making Manipal Institute of Technology a respected center for space technology.  Under the constant guidance of various scientists from the ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Vikram    Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) and a panel of faculties of MIT, critical milestones have been   cleared to launch our first satellite. As a research project we have presented more than 50    technical papers worldwide',
    description: 'The process is carried out in a state-of-the-art laboratory that has facilities like the functional Parikshit Ground Station(PGS) which can track satellites in orbit. There is also a clean room for testing and a soldering room for circuit prototyping and testing. ',
